## Installation Instructions

# pyEDM

    pip install pyEDM

# rEDM

    install.packages("rEDM")

# Note for Linux Users
We do not provide pyEDM or rEDM binaries for Linux machines. Instead our
setup script should build the respective package from scratch. We use 
a C++ base EDM engine in our packages, so you will need a modern gcc compiler.
