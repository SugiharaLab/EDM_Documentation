# EDM

EDM is a toolkit for analyzing time series of nonlinear dynamical systems,
with primary applications of forecasting and causal inference.  
  
The algorithms which comprise EDM, developed by George Sugihara, perform 
state space reconstruction via time delayed embeddings of time series data.
An overview of the algorithms provided is provided below and a more in-depth 
tutorial will be provided further in the documentation.   
  
The EDM algorithms are available in Python and R, in the packages pyEDM and rEDM, 
respectively.

# Why EDM is Necessary for Today's Data

Many fields use models as approximations of real world systems (e.g. testing 
hypotheses to explain mechanisms or processes or predicting future outcomes).   

However, real world systems are most often nonlinear and 
high dimensional, making explicit parametric equations impractical. Empirical
models, which infer patterns and associations from the data (instead of using 
discrete, hypothesized equations), represent a more natural and flexible 
approach to modeling the real world.  

Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) provides a framework for predicting and
analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems which are typically problematic for 
traditional modeling approaches.
